# Just found out how to format `Markdown`. Now I have cool big title 👍
## Smaller header because why not
##### Anyways here's some cool things about me
- 👋 Hi, I’m @NATURAL88 (very cool and not lame and cool 😎), I am a sophomore at my High School.
- 👀 I’m interested in, computers, gameing (gameing not gaming, there's a difference) and overall cool things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript in my AP Computer Science Principles class, but I also know some python and a bit of C# but not enough to say I'm good at it
- 💞️ I’m looking to *maybe* collaborate on some small things here and there. 
- 📫 How to reach me... you can't, not yet, but to make up for that here's a cool picture of a random dog I found on the internet ![Cool dog grinning](https://i.ibb.co/dL3SkR6/DC07-F9-D0-2333-4-C9-A-97-A9-816828-BF66-F4.jpg)
