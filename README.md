# Just found out how to *format* `Markdown`. Now I have cool big title 👍
## Smaller header because why not
##### Anyways here's some cool things about me
- 👋 Hi, I’m @NATURAL88 (very cool and not lame and cool 😎), I am a junior and I think that's pretty cool.
- 😈 I’m interested in, computers, gameing (gameing not gaming, there's a difference) and overall cool things.
- 💀 I’m currently learning javascript in my AP Computer Science Principles class, but I also know some python and a bit of C# but not enough to say I'm good at it
- 😘 I’m looking to *maybe* collaborate on some small things here and there. 
- 🤨 How to reach me... you can't, not yet, but to make up for that here's a cool picture of a random dog I found on the internet ![Cool dog grinning](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/537524566705045505/914421287328284673/dogo.jpg)
